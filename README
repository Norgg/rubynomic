This is a nomic, written in camping.

runnomic is an altered version of the camping server using mongrel only,
requiring everything necessary and then chrooting and setuiding to hopefully
stop people messing with your system too much.

To run:
Install camping.
Make sure you have diff and patch in your path.
Run camping nomic.rb

To run semi-securely:
Set up a chroot environment in which diff and patch can be run.

ldd /usr/bin/diff
ldd /usr/bin/patch

mkdir lib
mkdir bin
copy diff and patch into bin
copy the libs required for them into lib
make sure permissions are right

edit runnomic to change to the right uid for the user you want to run as

sudo ruby runnomic -d nomic.db nomic.rb

poke some stuff 'til it works, probably involving copying more libs or just
giving up and copying the whole of /lib.
